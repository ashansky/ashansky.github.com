I'm a tall and quiet software developer/engineer/hacker who lives in Orlando, FL with his beautiful wife, and life changing daughter. At my core I'm a technology geek who also loves getting away from the computer, and getting out into nature on a good backpacking trip.  

Never wanting my job or desires to define me. I am a son of the living God. I am constantly aware of my failures and the God who sees all of them yet still loves me and died for me.
